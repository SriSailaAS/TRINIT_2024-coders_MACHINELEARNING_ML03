For any farmer in the modern world, being able to forecast the best crop that could be cultivated in a specific place based on the soil composition, rainfall, temperature, and return on investment is crucial. By avoiding the risky practise of continually cultivating the same crops on the same plot of land, which depletes the soil of its natural resources, farmers might avoid spending extra money on fertilisers.


The Problem Statement is to predict the crop price for the crop recommended, and fertilizer prediction for the recommended crop.
